I'm a Project linked person in the Electronics and Communication Science Unit at the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata. My Research area mainly focuses on applying Machine Learning, specially Deep Learning, to the intersection of vision and language tasks. I have worked on various applied NLP and vision tasks such as video and image captioning, action recognition, text summarization, machine translation and grounding language in vision tasks. My long term goal is to reduce the cognitive gap between human and model performance by introducing reasoning capabilities to models.
